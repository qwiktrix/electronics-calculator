__Current Functionalities:__
* Capacitor Discharge Calculator - to safely discharge large capacitor voltages using power resistor


-------
#### TO DO:
- Separate main() code into separate application class
- Refactor variable input prompt into function call to reduce redundancy code
- Add in capacitor discharge resistor calculation
